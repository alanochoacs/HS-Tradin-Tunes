    <p class="purpletext" dir="ltr">Testimonial #1</p>
    <p class="left" dir="ltr">I, Jacob John was looking for The Beatles&rsquo; Abbey Road album, so I went to Tradin&rsquo; Tunes and I was treated like I was in a fancy restaurant for music. I asked an employee if they had Abbey Road and they walked me right to it, and I was walking to my car in a matter of seconds, smiling.</p>

    <p class="purpletext" dir="ltr">Testimonial #2</p>
    <p class="left">I, Susan Sam was looking for some a rock album for my Husband's birthday party and I decided to stop by Tradin' Tunes. I asked an employee if they knew any rock music that I can buy and I told him my husband likes Fall Out Boy, so he recommended Panic! At The Disco. Best decision in my life. My husband loved it.</p>

    <p class="purpletext">Testimonial #3</p>
    <p class="left">I, Henry Huss was getting a little bored with my music so I decided to go to Tradin' Tunes and trade them. I asked an employee how much them can give me for 5 Green Day albums and they gave me the best price around. Better yet them treated me super well. By the end I had new albums in my hands ready to play in my car's speakers.</p>
